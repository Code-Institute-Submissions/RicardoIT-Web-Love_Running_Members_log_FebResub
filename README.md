This project is an application that allows Users of the Love Running Website to log their runs througout the week.

Users will also have the choice of being able to track and monitor their progress on a weekly basis by choosing to provide total weekly targets to run.

The aplication will also include a feature which calculates Users' Body Mass Index (BMI) together with a link to a National Health Site where they will be able to find out more about BMI in more detail.
