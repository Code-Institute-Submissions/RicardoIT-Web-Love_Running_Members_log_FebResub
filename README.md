# Welcome to the Love Running Members Log

This project was developed to satisfy the third Milestone Project requirements of the Full Stack Web Development Program at the Code Institute. As a third project, this application is created using Python3 language.

The objective of this project is to build a command-line application that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

For this project I have decided to create an application that allows registered members of the Love Running Website to log their runs througout the week.

Registered members will also have the choice of being able to track and monitor their progress on a weekly basis by choosing to provide total weekly targets to run.

At the same time, the implication will include a feature for members to monitor their Body Mass Index (BMI).
